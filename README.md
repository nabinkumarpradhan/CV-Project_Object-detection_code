# CV-Project_Object-detection_code
The objective of the project is to propose a high-accuracy objection based on co-occurrence features. We will use three types of local co-occurrence features assembled the Haar, LBP and HOG respectively. In addition to this we will use Generalization and Efficiency Balanced (GEB) framework using Adaboost algorithm
# Pyhon library
OpenCV
